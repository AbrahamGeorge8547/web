								<span class="blog_heading"><br> Building a startup is not cool.</br> </span>
									<span class="byline">
										July-2019
									</span>
									<br>
									<br>
									<span class="blog_content">
										Everyone thinks of startup as a 100m Sprint, glamorizing the victory of crossing over the finishing line, standing ovation at your success, people praising and lauding you. The imagery of young people cashing in millions of dollars(some billions), writing “ I’m CEO bitch” in visiting cards, dating instagram models are far from reality. </p>
	  
									   <br>	Startup is a marathon,an uncertain race, the people who are passionate about the process jumps in and naturally completes it. There isn't anything cool about a marathon, other than persistence. The contents(mostly clickbaits) are irresponsible pied-pipers leading young people into ignorance, the flashy and lavish success stories hides the difficult and excruciating tasks that founders should take. Ofcourse, richess will follow the risk on the fly but executing the methods to build a wonderful organization results mostly in the pit-hole of ignorance.</br>
										 
									   <br> How to make it cool? A change in the perspective of things, there are a lot of things in a startup you can't control,admit that. It's a territory of unlimited personal growth,and accept the fact that what you think can be outright stupid. The prime-motto of any startup according to paul graham is to make something people want,and the founding team to ensure what you’re making is actually delighting the users.What makes a startup so amazing is the willingness of the founders to endure infinite hardships.
										  <br>
										<br> How to make the best of you? Startups gives you tremendous opportunity to work with people who are smarter than you,to learn and understand things from a different perspective,it can help you to think differently. A startup requires you to wear multiple hats, giving you a tremendous opportunity to be an expert generalist. The company growth will be a function of your own growth, to achieve that every startup founder should acquire knowledge everyday, skills like writing, voracious reading, accounting,etc are the skills that can be exploited. These are recipes that are seen in a great founder. If you consider all these as a personal metric and check upon these on a disciplined basis, the compounding effect will have a significant impact on you, your company and hence the world.
										 <br> 
										<br> If you start a startup, it will probably fail, the best case makes you rich and in the worst case(if you try) you could be a completely different person which you always want you to be. Entrepreneurship is a state of mind where you are constantly motivated to create something useful for people, irrespective of whether it makes money or not. If success is a given or highly likely, then what is the charm in being a startup founder?

							<br> <h3>	 Bad-blood by <span class="author"> John Carreyrou </span> : </h3></br>
							<span class="blog_content">
								  I distinctly remember my early college days constantly surfing through the web , reading blogs , inspired by steve jobs’s story of changing the world. One of the things that really got me interesting is how some silicon valley companies used ‘fake it till you make it’ in their early stages. </p>

								 <br>	Fake it till you make it is simply inflating their product’s relevance by doing some significant PR, the claims made by them would be an outright lie to raise capital and hire smart people to develop it. This method is mostly a desperate attempt to avoid bankruptcy or to achieve insane growth.</p></br>
									
								  John carreyrou, a pulitzer prize winner and journalist at wall street journal unearths the hidden fraud of the late darling of Silicon Valley, Theranos.This is the kind of book that you hesitate to put down before completion. This removes the rose tinted glasses and portrays the darker and disgusting aspect of silicon valley’s startup ecosystem. 
									
									Elizabeth Holmes, ambitious Stanford drop-out inspired by steve jobs set out to disrupt the world’s healthcare with just a drop of blood. She associated with Sunny Balwani, a businessman who got lucky with fortunes during the infamous dot-com bubble. If you people ever watch Silicon valley sitcom(i recommend)  he’s similar to Erlich bachman. He knows a thing or two about startups but a person with minimal values. Elizabeth’s ambition for power and success , along with Sunny’s mentoring blindly convinced her to bend values solely for the success of theranos.
									
									The book takes you dramatically through the inception of Theranos and how young Elizabeth transforms herself to built one of the biggest deceits and frauds in Silicon Valley history. </p> </br>

							<br> <h3>	 The Six Wives of Henry VIII by <span class="author"> Alison Weir </span> : </h3></br>

							<span class="blog_content">
									<br>This is the kind of book one hesitate to read because its very long.It's brilliantly written but it has some gray areas which can ooze out the motivation to read.
								</p>
 
									<br>	This is the only book i’ve read that speaks from the female point of view. This revolves around the story of Henry VIII’s six wives and his other mistresses. It brilliantly portrays the lives of Kings, Queens and other people in victorian europe in detail. If you’re the kind of person who would love to know about how people live in the early times , this is a book for you. It details the aspect of architecture, religion, tradition, social conventions and lifestyle of medieval europe. It also portrays how the Kings and Queens were powerful enough to bend all of these for their personal goodwill</br>
									 
									<br> Henry VIII’s been the most insecure king in victorian england. Henry’s passion for love varied as he pass on with his age. He starts of the most loving husband in the world, and his ambition for having a male heir corrupts his heart to change wives like the how actors change outfits in typical bollywood songs. The profile of the six wives is the most interesting part. This book can be called as a factual entertainer,with unbiased writing from the author. It makes you think back about our history with marvel and disgust. Henry’s such a spontaneous character which makes the readers curious till the end. In a sense, the comparison i could make with henry VIII is Darth Vader. You never dislike him for being ruthless and stupid.
									 
									 </br>
									 <br> Alison Weir has done full justice to this well researched and well articulated masterpiece, the details of the people portrayed are so elaborate and the sense of understanding it beholds is truly fascinating. For me many of the aspects concluded in a pity conviction for the woman in that era as being suppressed and given no dignity by some powerful men in medieval europe.No person now ever living would be as powerful as Henry VIII, He manipulated religion, tradition, public opinions even chopping of several heads for no reasons to get married for a male heir.
